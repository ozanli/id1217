concurrent programming

This project implements both sequential and concurrent versions of Jacobi method to find solutions of a strictly diagonally dominant system of linear equations and Multigrid method for solving differential equations using a hierarchy of discretizations. The main aim of the project is to parallelize sequential programs.
