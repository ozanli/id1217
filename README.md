# What is this project about? 
This project implements both sequential and concurrent versions of Jacobi method to find solutions of a strictly diagonally dominant system of linear equations. The main aim of the project is to parallelize the sequential Jacobi method to see how much of a speedup is possible to achieve, i.e. how faster we can make the same solution run.
