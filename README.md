# What is this project about? 
This project implements both sequential and concurrent versions of Multigrid method for solving differential equations using a hierarchy of discretizations. The main aim of the project is to parallelize the sequential Multigrid method to see how much of a speedup can be gained, i.e. how much faster we can make our solution run.
